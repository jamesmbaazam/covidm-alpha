## Installing on Windows

### For R version 4.0.0 or later

These instructions were tested on Windows using R 4.0.2.

1. Download the `Rtools40` installer for Windows from CRAN. (Go to https://www.r-project.org/, following the links to download R for Windows, select a mirror, click through to Rtools, download the installer).

2. Run the Rtools installer.

3. So that R can find tools bundled with Rtools, run this command from R:
```R
writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron")
```
This creates a file called `.Renviron` in your Documents folder and writes the line `PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"` to it. You can also do this manually if you prefer.

4. To test your Rtools installation, restart R and type:
```R
Sys.which("make")
## "C:\\rtools40\\usr\\bin\\make.exe"
```
It should give you a path like the above rather than an empty string.

5. Finally, install the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) using Rtools' `pacman` utility. Go to Start > Rtools > Rtools Bash. At the prompt type
```
pacman -Sy
```
to update the package list for pacman, then
```
pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-gsl
```
to install GSL.

6. You can now install covidm from Github. First make sure you have the `remotes` package installed
```R
install.packages("remotes")
```
then install covidm from github:
```R
remotes::install_github("nicholasdavies/covidm-alpha")
```
And you're done.

### For R before version 4.0.0

This was tested using R version 3.6.3.

1. Install the correct version of Rtools for your version of R (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/history.html). For example, for version 3.6.3 you want Rtools35.exe.

2. Run the Rtools installer. The instructions that follow assume you install to C:\Rtools, the recommended directory.

3. So that R can find tools bundled with Rtools, run this command from R:
```R
writeLines('PATH="C:\\Rtools\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron")
```
This creates a file called `.Renviron` in your Documents folder and writes the line `PATH="C:\\Rtools\\bin;${PATH}"` to it. You can also do this manually if you prefer.

4. Download a prebuilt GSL library by downloading `localXXX.zip` from http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies/multilib/. As of May 2nd 2020 the latest version was `local323.zip`. Download this file and unzip the contents to a folder of your choosing; for example, to `C:/Users/[YourUsername]/Documents/GSL`. The zip file contains two folders, `include` and `lib`; in the example folder, the full path to these two folders would be `C:/Users/[YourUsername]/Documents/GSL/include` and `C:/Users/[YourUsername]/Documents/GSL/lib`.

5. Go to your `Documents` folder (i.e. `C:/Users/[YourUsername]/Documents`), and make the folder `.R` if it does not exist. (The dot at the start of the folder name is important.) Make a new plain text file (e.g. in Notepad), paste the two lines below making the appropriate changes to `[YourUsername]` as needed and save it as `C:/Users/[YourUsername]/Documents/.R/Makevars.win`.
```
PKG_CPPFLAGS=-I "C:/Users/[YourUsername]/Documents/GSL/include" -I../inst/include
PKG_LIBS=-L "C:/Users/[YourUsername]/Documents/GSL/lib/i386" -lgsl -lgslcblas
```
**Note: The path `C:/Users/[YourUsername]/Documents/GSL` in the two `Makevars.win` lines in step 4 should be the same path where you unzipped the include and lib directories as in step 3. The quotation marks around the paths in each line are needed if the paths contain spaces.**

6. You can now install covidm from Github. First make sure you have the `remotes` package installed
```R
install.packages("remotes")
```
then install covidm from github:
```R
remotes::install_github("nicholasdavies/covidm-alpha")
```
And you're done.

## Installing on Mac OS X

### For R version 4.0.0 or later

1. Install the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) by typing
```
brew install gsl
```
in the Terminal.

2. (*Optional*) If you want covidm to be able to use multithreading (i.e. speed up simulations by distributing them across multiple processor cores), you will need to install OpenMP support. The latest instructions for how to do this on Mac OS X are available at https://mac.r-project.org/openmp, but here's the gist of it:

> a. Type `clang -v` in the Terminal to see which version of **clang** you have installed. You are looking for something like `Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-YYYY.12.34.56)` â€” it's the 4-digit YYYY number you need.

> b. Go to https://mac.r-project.org/openmp and look in the table under **OpenMP run-time downloads** for the right file. Under the **Build** header, you'll see that each file corresponds to an LLVM version, an XCode version, and an Apple clang version; you want the **Release** file that corresponds to the Apple clang version YYYY from step a. 

> c. Type `curl -O https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/openmp-9.0.1-darwin17-Release.tar.gz` in the Terminal, substituting the file name you need, in the Terminal to download OpenMP.

> d. Then run `sudo tar fvx openmp-9.0.1-darwin17-Release.tar.gz -C /` in the Terminal to install OpenMP. You will be asked for your password.

> e. Finally, add the following two lines to `~/.R/Makevars` to enable OpenMP support in R:

>> `CPPFLAGS += -Xclang -fopenmp`

>> `LDFLAGS += -lomp`

5. You can now install covidm from Github. First make sure you have the `remotes` package installed
```R
install.packages("remotes")
```
then install covidm from github:
```R
remotes::install_github("nicholasdavies/covidm-alpha")
```
And you're done.

### For R before version 4.0.0

1. First, you need to install gfortran binaries from here: https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases.

2. Then, install the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) by typing
```
brew install gsl
```
in the Terminal.

3. Now, run 
```
gcc --version
```
in the Terminal to get your current version, e.g. `Target: x86_64-apple-darwin18.8.2.0`. 

4. Finally, run this in Terminal, substituting the version from step 3 into the last line:
```
cd ~
mkdir .R
cd .R
echo FLIBS=-L/usr/local/gfortran/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin18/8.2.0 -L/usr/local/gfortran/lib -lgfortran -lquadmath -lm >> Makevars
```

5. You can now install covidm from Github. First make sure you have the `remotes` package installed
```R
install.packages("remotes")
```
then install covidm from github:
```R
remotes::install_github("nicholasdavies/covidm-alpha")
```
And you're done.
