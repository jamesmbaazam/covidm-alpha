Description: covidm is an age-structured metapopulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
    The library is optimised for speed and allows simulating pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical
    interventions and model fitting, and comes bundled with demographic and contact data for
    many countries around the world. The code was developed at the London School of Hygiene and
    Tropical Medicine's Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases.
